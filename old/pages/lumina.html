    <p>Lumina is an interactive seating installation which facilitates knowledge-exchange between peers.</p>

    <p>Lumina was created for the Interactive Seating Design Competition, an interdisciplinary class which was piloted and sponsored by the Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation at UC Berkeley in Spring 2015.</p>

    <p>Students in the class came from majors and backgrounds including EECS, art practice, mechanical engineering, architecture, bioengineering, cognitive science, business, and more. When it came time to form teams for the final project, we each put on a nametag with color-coded stickers corresponding to specific skillsets (ie: coding, electronics, fabrication, team management, etc.) in order to identify who had a complementary background and would be good to team up with. The exercise was a little messy, with people shuffling around the lab, trying to see people's nametags.</p>

    <p>From our experience forming teams and personal observation, we realized that meeting new people, even in a safe academic setting surrounded by peers, can be intimidating and difficult. Furthermore, some personal research I had conducted suggested that Berkeley students interested in design struggled with two main issues: confusion regarding how to learn new skills/improve what they already know and a lack of a strong design community on campus. Making new friends is hard, but meeting people who are knowledgeable about specific tools you're trying to learn about is even harder.</p>

    <p>Lumina is intended to facilitate social interaction between peers in common areas of educational communities. For instance, having an array of lumina chairs in a lab or lounge area of Jacobs Hall enables students to broadcast their expertise through the color of their seat.</p>

    <p>A small Bluetooth Low Energy beacon mounted underneath the seat transmits the chairâ€™s location and communicates with an Android mobile application we developed. The mobile app uses the proximity of the BLE signal to control a Philips Hue bulb in the base of the chair.</p>

    <p>The final chair was constructed out of waterjet polycarbonate and clear acrylic. Foam was used to cushion the seat, and a lycra fabric was used to sew a cover which would diffuse the light and create a cohesive look.</p>
