    <h1>Design at Berkeley</h1>

    <div class="text">

    <p>Design at Berkeley is a project I worked on to create a one-stop resources for undergraduates interested in design. As a member of Design Council, an undergraduate student organization dedicated to promoting design culture, education and awareness at UC Berkeley, I volunteered to lead and work on the initiative.</p>

    <h4>USER RESEARCH</h4>
    <p>Initially, we had a vague idea of what problem we wanted to solve: there was a clear lack of resources available for students interested in design. Course recommendations were scattered and difficult to discover. Student organizations were disparate from each other and mostly advertised by word-of-mouth. It seemed that many students who considered themselves part of the design community on campus had simply gotten lucky and met the right people. There was no clear or direct way for students who were just starting out to pursue their interests.</p>

    <p>We conducted interviews with undergraduate students across campus from various majors, grades, and design backgrounds. Students generally fell into one of the following buckets:</p>

    <h5>Involved</h5>
    <p>Involved students are typically members of several design clubs and have taken design courses. They tend to want <span class="">a stronger community to bond with</span> and <span class="">more classes which cater to their specific design interest</span>. They also are interested in <span class="">professional development</span> and want to know which tools they should know for specific design careers.</p>

    <h5>Interested</h5>
    <p>Interested students are typically in one club or class on campus but really want to learn more about design. They can be <span class="">confused about the different branches of design</span> and <span class="">don't know how to get more involved in clubs and projects</span>.</p>

    <h5>Unsure</h5>
    <p>Unsure students have been exposed to design but are at a loss as to how to find out more information. They often <span class="">don't know what design even is</span> and are too <span class="">scared or intimidated</span> to step into it.</p>

    <p>Interviews proved to be an incredibly insight into how students who are interested or unsure feel about design at Berkeley. As someone who has been lucky enough to meet the right people and become involved with design through several organizations and classes, I approached this project purely from the mindset of an involved student. Interviews with unsure students allowed me to discover an unsettling amount of <span class="">disillusionment and frustration regarding the lack of design resources</span> readily available. From</p>

    <p>"There’s not an access point to the design community at Berkeley"</p>

    <p>"If it’s going to be really hard getting classes and getting access, I’m not going to fight for that."</p>


    <p>With these insights in mind, we worked to create a welcoming website which would act as a one-stop hub for students interested in design.</p>


    <p>I designed illustrations in a loose style in a conscious effort to make the site feel friendly, approachable, and fun.</p>

    <p>The brand palette consists of bright inviting colors (no red included, go bears!)</p>
