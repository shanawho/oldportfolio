    <h1>Working with Typography DeCal</h1>

    <div class="text">

    <p>Working with Typography is a 2-unit DeCal course I created and facilitated in Spring 2015. It is offered under UC Berkeley's Democratic Education (DeCal) program, which allows students to take classes created and taught by their peers for credit toward graduation. Class met for 2 hours every week and featured 45&ndash;60 minutes of peer feedback in small groups, a short lesson, and (sometimes) a small in-class activity.</p>

    <p>Much of the available graphic design curriculum at Berkeley is run by students and focuses on technical skills. I wanted a class which would allow for stylistic development, critical practice, and exploration. I figured it was unlikely anyone else would create my perfect class, so I decided to start it myself.</p>

    <p>Typography is an essential tool for designers of all backgrounds. It is a universal tool for communication. My main goal with the Working with Typography DeCal was to expose students to a variety of design disciplines through typography and teach them to broaden their horizons. </p>


    <h4>PEDAGOGY</h4>
    <p>The course emphasizes application-based learning. I wanted to assign projects which were creatively stimulating and would encourage students to become more comfortable working with type. It is very much an exploratory course in typography for students with intermediate design background and a technical understanding of Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>

    <p>The main goal of the course was to use typography as a lens through which students could explore a wide variety of media. I believe young designers have a tendency to become siloed in one field. My students came from backgrounds in print design, architecture, web design, human-centered design, and other disciplines. I wanted to push them beyond the boundaries of what they already knew. By assigning small assignments in unfamiliar areas, I hoped to teach students that their potential as a designer extends far beyond their previous work, and that with a little practice, they are more than capable of branching into other disciplines.</p>

    <p>The course emphasizes constructive critique and constant iteration. </p>


    <h4>RESEARCH</h4>
    <p>I loosely modeled Working with Typography after Art Center's typography curriculum, which start with a foundation in letterform creation and culminate in an involved transmedia installation project. Whereas Art Center's curriculum spans several trimesters, my DeCal only has one semester, a mere 12 weeks. As a result, Working with Typography is very much an exploratory !!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <p>I also researched the most effective methods of conducting critiques and applied them in-class. Every week, I asked students to split into groups of 5 or 6, and spend time talking through their project with their peers. Students were asked to come with questions regarding specific feedback they were seeking.</p>

    <p>As a university student myself, I chose to assume the role of a facilitator rather than an instructor during critiques, going around and encouraging students to present their projects and give feedback. The course's weekly critiques were intended to build good habits in students to ask for feedback and also to help them become comfortable with presenting their own work.</p>

    <p>In preparation for planning this course, I read and referenced a lot of typography books, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Just My Type</li>
      <li>Typographic Systems</li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>


    <h4>PROJECTS</h4>
    <p>Students worked on two main projects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Midterm book project to practice typography in a print-based context.</li>
      <li>Final museum project to create a cohesive identity system and create materials which span across media.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>EVALUATION</h4>
    <p>Considering Spring 2015 was the first time Working with Typography was offered, the course had favorable student reviews. </p>

    <p>What went well?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Small class size (17 admitted, 13 stayed) enabled students to bond and give feedback comfortably</li>
      <li>Students generally enjoyed the breadth of knowledge offered by the course</li>
      <li>Students considered projects fun and extensive enough to include in personal portfolios</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What could be better?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students desired more depth in certain subjects and more time to develop projects and skills.</li>
      <li>Timing was not perfect. Some lessons should be shuffled in the future to allow more time for certain projects and to lesson the homework burden during stressful times such as midterm season.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What I learned</p>
    <p>
      This was the first time I created an entire course from scratch, and I had high hopes for what we could complete in one semester. I tried to craft a curriculum that I would have been excited about as a student and to include lessons and assignments that were interesting and stimulating. However, DeCal's are still only 2 unit P/NP courses, and students have other priorities.
