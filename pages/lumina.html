    <h1>Lumina</h1>

    <p>Lumina is an interactive seating installation which facilitates knowledge-exchange between peers. Lumina was created for the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/2015/08/interactive-seating-new-course-models-design-innovation-education" target="_blank">Interactive Seating Design Competition</a>, an interdisciplinary class which was piloted and sponsored by the <a href="http://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation</a> at UC Berkeley in Spring 2015.</p>

    <p>Students in the class came from a variety of backgrounds which was great for forming interdisciplinary teams. To form our final project teams, we used color-coded name tags to find peers with complementary skills.</p>

    <p>We realized that it's difficult to find others with specific skills. Meeting new people, even in a safe academic setting surrounded by peers, can be intimidating and difficult. Furthermore, some research I conducted suggested that Berkeley students interested in design struggled with how to improve their skills and with meeting new people in the design community.</p>

    <p>Lumina helps start the conversation. Students select a skillset they're knowledgeable about on a mobile app, which communicates to the closest Lumina chair. Whenever the student is seated, the chair glows the color which is associated with their selected skill. By having an array of Lumina chairs in a makerspace, for instance, students can easily find someone who shares their interests or who can teach them something new.</p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>We purposely kept app interaction light to create a more natural physical experience. I prototyped with Framer.js and then built out the app in Android.</p>

    <h4>Technology</h4>
    <p>A small Bluetooth Low Energy beacon mounted underneath the seat transmits the chairâ€™s location and communicates with an Android mobile application we developed. The mobile app uses the proximity of the BLE signal to control a Philips Hue bulb in the base of the chair.</p>

    <h4>Fabrication</h4>
    <p>The final chair was constructed out of waterjet polycarbonate and clear acrylic. Foam was used to cushion the seat, and a cover was sewn out of lycra fabric to diffuse light and create a cohesive look.</p>

    <h4>Branding</h4>
    <p>Lumina comes from the Latin for light, referencing both our use of a bulb as the main feature of our chair and the intention of Lumina to help spread the light of knowledge.</p>
