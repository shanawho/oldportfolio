    <h1>Lumina</h1>

    <p>Lumina is an interactive seating installation which facilitates knowledge-exchange between peers. Lumina was created for the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/2015/08/interactive-seating-new-course-models-design-innovation-education" target="_blank">Interactive Seating Design Competition</a>, an interdisciplinary class which was piloted and sponsored by the <a href="http://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation</a> at UC Berkeley in Spring 2015.</p>

    <p>Students in the class came from a variety of backgrounds which was great for forming interdisciplinary teams. To find our final project teams, we each put on a nametag with color-coded stickers corresponding to specific skillsets. We used the color coding on our name tags to find people with complementary skills and to form teams.</p>

    <p>We realized that it's difficult to find people with specific skills without being explicit like in our team forming activity. Meeting new people, even in a safe academic setting surrounded by peers, can be intimidating and difficult. Furthermore, some research I had conducted suggested that Berkeley students interested in design struggled with two main issues: confusion regarding how to learn new skills/improve what they already know and a lack of a strong design community on campus. Making new friends is hard, but meeting people who are knowledgeable about specific tools you're trying to learn about is even harder.</p>

    <p>Lumina helps start the conversation. Each chair connects to a mobile app through which students can select a skillset they're knowledgeable about and willing to help others with. Whenever the student is seated, their chair glows the color which is associated with their selected skill. By having an array of lumina chairs in a makerspace, for instance, students can look around and easily find someone who shares their interests or who can teach them something new.</p>

    <h4>DESIGN</h4>
    <p>We purposely kept the app interaction light to enable people to act naturally. The goal was to let students select their speciality, which then communicates to the chair to change color every time she is seated. I prototyped with Framer.js and then built out the app in Android.</p>

    <h4>TECHNOLOGY</h4>
    <p>A small Bluetooth Low Energy beacon mounted underneath the seat transmits the chairâ€™s location and communicates with an Android mobile application we developed. The mobile app uses the proximity of the BLE signal to control a Philips Hue bulb in the base of the chair.</p>

    <h4>FABRICATION</h4>
    <p>The final chair was constructed out of waterjet polycarbonate and clear acrylic. Foam was used to cushion the seat, and a lycra fabric was used to sew a cover which would diffuse light and create a cohesive look.</p>

    <h4>BRANDING</h4>
    <p>Lumina comes from the Latin for light, referencing both our use of a bulb as the main feature of our chair and the intention of Lumina to help spread the light of knowledge.</p>
