        <h1>Nearby Friends</h1>

        <p>During Fall 2015, I was a product design intern at Facebook where I worked on Nearby&nbsp;Friends, an opt-in real-time location product.</p>

        <p>I learned a lot from working in a product space which encompassed challenges like approximate location, reciprocal sharing, and designing for scale. I was the second designer on the Real-Time Location Team and worked with an extensive crossfunctional team.</p>

        <p>Most my work is pre-launch, but keep an eye out! </p>
