    <h1>32pt</h1>

    <p>Many merchants who offer letterpress services often spend much of their time dealing with issues such as incorrect file types, image sizes, and related problems. The additional conversations with customers which these issues require could be easily prevented with a system that prevents error in the first place.</p>

    <p>A friend approached me about working on a project to curb the many errors that printers deal with. The project was 32pt, which is an online webservice connecting letterpress printers and their customers. 32pt handles images so that  focuses on creating an easy-to-use interface for anyone to design a handsome business card.</p>

    <p>We developed three personas for sample users:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Jane already has a design already created in an external program. She's already finalized her design and just wants to get it out to print.</li>

        <li>Marc wants to create his own card and has a good design aesthetics. He has an idea of what he wants but needs a platform to create it.</li>

        <li>Susan wants to create a card online but has little design experience.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>While my teammates developed the backend to handle the case for our first user flow, I worked on the custom designer for the latter two sample users. I worked on designing and developing an interface in which users could directly manipulate the text and images they wished to include on their card. This was a huge step up from most mainstream printing companies' online design interfaces.</p>

    <p>The interface was designed to be clean and devoid of unnecessary distractions. Editing options only appear if they are applicable and all options disappear when nothing is selected. I also implemented an undo-redo stack, for all those mistakes we all make during the design process.</p>

    <p>32pt is a work-in-progress.</span></p>
