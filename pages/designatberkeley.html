        <h1>Design at Berkeley</h1>
    <p>Design at Berkeley is a project I worked on to create a comprehensive website for undergraduates interested in design. As a member of Design Council, an undergraduate student organization dedicated to promoting design culture, education and awareness at UC Berkeley, I volunteered to lead and work on the initiative.</p>

    <h4>USER RESEARCH</h4>
    <p>There was a clear lack of resources available for students interested in design. Course recommendations were scattered and difficult to discover. Student organizations were disparate from each other and mostly advertised by word-of-mouth. It seemed that many students who considered themselves part of the design community on campus had simply gotten lucky and met the right people. There was no clear or direct way for students who were just starting out to pursue their interests.</p>

    <p>We conducted interviews with undergraduate students across campus from various majors, grades, and design backgrounds to better understand their needs. Students generally fell into one of the following categories:</p>

    <div class="third">
      <h5>Involved</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>In multiple design clubs</li>
        <li>Taken design courses</li>
        <li>Want a stronger community to bond with, more classes for specific interests, professional development</li>
      </li>
    </div>

    <div class="third">
      <h5>Interested</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>In one club or class</li>
        <li>Still confused about different design disciplines</li>
        <li>Don't know how to get involved in more clubs or projects</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="third">
      <h5>Unsure</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>Don't have clear understanding about what design truly is</li>
        <li>Don't know how to find out more about design</li>
        <li>Often scared or intimidated to get involved</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Interviews proved to be an incredibly insight into how students who are interested or unsure feel about design at Berkeley. As someone who has been lucky enough to meet the right people and become involved with design through several organizations and classes, I approached this project from the mindset of an involved student. Interviews with unsure students allowed me to discover an unsettling amount of <span class="">disillusionment and frustration regarding the lack of design resources</span> readily available.</p>

    <p>With these insights in mind, we worked to create a welcoming website which would act compile relevant resources for students interested in design.</p>
