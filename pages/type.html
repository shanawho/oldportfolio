    <h1>Working with Typography DeCal</h1>
    <p>During my junior year at Berkeley, I created and facilitated a 2-unit P/NP Democratic Education course called Working with Typography. It was a class that I have always wanted to take, and something I felt like the Berkeley design community sorely needed. I realized that if I didn't start it, no one else would, so I spent my winter break researching typography courses, planning curriculum, and designing projects.</p>

    <p>Working with Typography is intended to teach students about the foundations and applications of typography and lettering. It's also an exploratory course that introduces students to a variety of design disciplines through the tool of typography in an attempt to broaden their horizons.</p>

    <p>The course was heavily based on hands-on activities and homework assignments with the intent of giving students opportunities to create projects for their portfolios. Students also routinely presented their work and gave constructive criticism to their peers in small groups.</p>

    <p>To help everyone get to know each other, our first class included a fun in-class activity of making type with food.</p>
