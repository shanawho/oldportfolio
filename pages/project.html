    <h1>DaVinci Mobile</h1>

    <div class="text">

    <p><span class="hilight">DaVinci Mobile is LinkedIn's pattern library for designers and developers.</span> I worked on both design and development, volunteering to develop the hub page to expedite the project. The final project is <span class="hilight">fully-responsive so designers can see components in context on a mobile device</span>.</p>

    <p>Davinci Mobile originally was a linked PDF. Although the PDF allowed designers to access the information they needed, the setup didnâ€™t scale well and provided limited resources for developers. The solution was to create an online pattern library which fit in with its preexisting sister branches, DaVinci Desktop and DaVinci Tools, but also establish its own style representative of LinkedIn's mobile brand.</p>

    <p><span class="hilight">I designed layouts and specs for both desktop and mobile-responsive pages.</span> We wanted to experiment with how different we could design the mobile layouts in order to make them appear more like native apps rather than a mobile version of a desktop site.</p>

    <p>Here I drafted wireframes for the mobile hub page. We originally explored version 1, but after conducting some user testing, we realized version 2 was <span class="hilight">easier to parse and navigate on an actual mobile device.</span></p>

    <p>Although I was originally only supposed to work on design, I stepped up and <span class="hilight">volunteered to expedite the project by also working on development.</span> Throughout the project I worked closely with designers, web developers, and a fellow intern whose summer project was to implement the lower component pages I had designed.</p>
