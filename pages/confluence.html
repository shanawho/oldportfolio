    <h1>Confluence</h1>

    <div class="text">
    <p><span class="hilight">Confluence connects language learners across the globe so learners can practice their pronunciation, improve their fluency, and receive feedback from native speakers.</span> Learners interact through a <span class="hilight">crowdsourced Q&amp;A platform</span> where they can record their questions and <span class="hilight">receive personal feedback on their own voice</span>.</p>

    <p>Confluence was originally designed and developed as part of CS 160: User Interface Design &amp; Development at UC Berkeley. <span class="hilight">I've also redesigned the project since the conclusion of the course.</span></p>


    <h4>USER RESEARCH</h4>
    <p>In order to better understand the issues foreign language learners face, my team and I interviewed learners from various backgrounds including: 

      <ul>
        <li>Students studying in a high-caliber educational environment</li>
        <li>Students enrolled in a five week study abroad program in the US from Japan</li>
        <li>Professionals working abroad, learning on the side</li>
      </ul>

    <p>The issues our interviewees faced fell into three categories:</p>

    <div class="third">
      <h5>Environmental</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Traditional educational environments focus on reading, writing, &amp; vocabulary</li>
        <li>Learners get more practice speaking when studying abroad</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="third">
      <h5>Personal</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Students shy or embarrassed about their accent are less likely to practice</li>
        <li>Working professionals don't have large blocks of time to dedicate</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="third">
      <h5>Cultural</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Some cultures tend to discourage speaking up in class or practicing vocalization</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>The research brought up some interesting concerns we wanted to tackle. We realized that mobile technology allows us to create a space which encourages learners to focus on pronunciation, while connecting remote users who can help each other. <span class="hilight">Learners can learn on their own time and at their own pace, as well as ask questions in a format which is less intimidating than face to face.</span></p>


    <h4>PROTOTYPING &AMP; USER TESTING</h4>

    <p>We designed and developed multiple round of prototypes. Below are some hilights about what we learned from user testing.</p>

    <p><span class="hilight">We originally wanted to build an app with equal focus on a crowdsourced dashboard and partner-based conversational messaging.</span> After user testing, we discovered several concerns with partner messaging. How do you know if your partner is reliable or correct? What if your partner is a slow replier? As a result, <span class="hilight">we scrapped messaging to focus on crowdsourced Q&amp;A, which our users were excited about.</span></p>

    <p>Low-fi prototype user testing revealed that users had difficulty using our recording interface and the countdown we included to indicate time left was too ambiguous. We quickly iterated on our design once more to produce our final deliverable shown below.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>This was the final version of our class project. We <span class="hilight">integrated the recording interface</span> with the rest of the question-asking activity and developed a subtle progress bar to give the user feedback of their recording in progress.</p>

    <p><span class="hilight">Our final class project was fully developed in Android with Node.js. My team consisted of Erik Bartlett, Brian Yin, and Nahush Bhanage.</span> </p>

    <h4>PROJECT REDESIGN</h4>

    <p><span class="hilight">I decided to redesign the project</span> because the course had a heavy emphasis on implementation, and I was unsatisfied with how our final design turned out. I focused on cleaning up the interface and incorporating a more purposeful focus on human interaction. </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/confluence/profile.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>I updated the news feed and included profile pages. The addition of profile photos adds an element of trust into the application, making users more relatable and allows users to have a profile to track their progress and contributions.</p>


    <figure>

    </figure>

    <p>I simplified the recording interface even more by utilizing a hold-to-record quasimode. A pulsating animation lets the user know the application is recording. Recordings are automatically attached, allowing users to delete and re-record if they wish.</p>

    <h4>A PERSONAL NOTE</h4>

      <p>This Fall I'll be the reader/grader for CS 160! I'm super excited to join the teaching staff and help out with the course.</p>
