    <h2>Hello! I'm Shana (<em>shay-na</em>).</h2>

    <p>
      I work at the intersection of design and development. I'm passionate about storytelling, creativity, empathy, and education. And also lettering. I love lettering.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a 3<sup>rd</sup> year computer science major at UC Berkeley. I have a deep respect and even deeper curiosity for how things work. When I was a baby I used crawl behind the TV and unplug all the cables. And thus began my journey of moving fast and breaking things.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I can be found doing some late-night lettering or being happily confused by postmodern literature. In a past life, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Ex-o_3x3g" target="_blank">I played a lot of piano</a>.

    <h4>ABOUT THIS SITE</h4>
    <p>
      I built this site with Angular.js and Sass during my last stretch of summer break instead of going to the beach because let's be honest, this is way more fun.
