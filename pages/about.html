    		I have always wanted to learn everything I could, whether it be art, science, or something in between.

    		I work at the intersection of design and engineering. I'm currently a product design intern at <a href="http://facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. Recently, I was a design intern at <a href="http://fiftythree.com" target="_blank">FiftyThree</a> on the Prototyping Team. And last summer, I was a web development and design intern at <a href="http://linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

    		I'm also a senior at UC Berkeley, where I've channeled my love of learning into teaching. I was an undergraduate student instructor for <a href="http://pact.eecs.berkeley.edu/cs160/" target="_blank">CS 160/260A: User Interface Design &amp; Development</a>. I also started the class I always wish I had, Working with Typography, and taught Photoshop and Illustrator.
