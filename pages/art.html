	<h1>I grew up drawing nonstop</h1>

	<p>One of my earliest memories is putting my Beanie Babies in poses and trying to copy them on paper with crayons. By high school, I had developed an almost unhealthy obsession with portraiture (my mother practically begged me to go outside and play). Nowadays I still enjoy drawing when I can, although I've shifted my focus to other pursuits like design.</p>

	<p>I love details and how they add up to create a dazzling larger picture. My favorite parts about drawing has always been the challenge in capturing a slice of reality. I particularly love portraiture because of its power to capture a person's character. Fine art is something I consider akin to magic.</p>

	<p>Though I've dabbled in digital painting, acrylics, oils, watercolors, and more, my preferred medium is still graphite. There is quite nothing like the feel of working with paper and pencil.</p>

	<h4>SOME THANK YOUS</h4>
	<p>I also like painting presents for people as thank you gifts! These are some (but not all) of the teachers and mentors I've had in various different disciplines who have helped me along the way.</p>

	<h4>AND YOU CAN TOO</h4>

	<p>A lot of people I've talked to seem to assume that artistic skill isn't something that can be learned. This is not true. You just have to stick with it! Practice does wonders. If I hadn't kept drawing while growing up, I would probably still be drawing misshapen Beanie Babies with crayons.</p>
