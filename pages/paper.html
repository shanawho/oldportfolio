        <h1>Paper: Onboarding</h1>
    	<p>
    		During the summer of 2015, I was a design intern on the prototyping team at <a href="http://fiftythree.com" target="_blank">FiftyThree</a>, where I worked on onboarding for Paper 3.0, now available on iPhone.
    	</p>

		<h4>Initial Prototyping</h4>


	    <p>The initial idea was to introduce small pointers at opportune times and let users discover helpful tips voluntarily. Tips lead to the Tip Center, letting people know more help is available if needed.</p>

	    </video>

	    <video class="mobile-proto second" controls>
	    	<source src="../video/paper-orange.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
	    </video>


	    <div class="clearfix"></div>
	    <p>I built two fully interactive prototypes and tested them with new and returning users. The two prototypes differed in app entry point, pointer color, and tip design. We quickly learned that starting in the text canvas was confusing, and that people were so engrossed with the sample content, they didn't even see the pointers.</p>


		<h4>Rapid Iteration</h4>

		<p>
			We decided to skip the pointers and directly introduce tips. I iterated quickly in between user tests to build a prototype which would introduce tips at opportune moments. These tips lived directly on top of the app content, allowing users to directly interact with the content if they wished. For example, they could immediately test out the drag-to-reorder feature. See it on the left below.

	    	<source src="../video/paper-tip.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>

	    <video class="mobile-proto second" controls>
	    	<source src="../video/paper-modal-tip.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
	    </video>

	    <div class="clearfix"></div>
		<p>
			However, more testing revealed that most people tapped or swiped away the tips without reading them. For the next iteration, I added a modal backdrop to make tips harder to accidentally dismiss. This design tested better than the non-modal tip, but some users still instinctively dismissed the tip pointer.
		</p>

		<h4>Tip Center Explorations</h4>
		<p>
			During user testing, we determined the tip center should be accessible from all screens. I worked on visual explorations for what it might mean to move the "?" out of the canvas tray.

		<p>
			We decided to place the "?" mark in the top right of all views, tying it visually with the user avatar (its permanent home). I also worked on making the tip center contextual, surfacing the most relevant tips first. I prototyped both a hierarchical Tip Center and a long Tip Center.

		<h4>Final Design</h4>
		<p>
			Rapid prototyping allowed us to quickly test designs with real users and gain insight toward a better experience. The final onboarding design features large tips with explicit dismissal buttons, a contextual long Tip Center, and smooth tip-to-tip gestural navigation. Check it out on iPhone and iPad!
