        <h1>Paper: Onboarding</h1>
    	<p>
    		During the summer of 2015, I was a design intern on the prototyping team at <a href="http://fiftythree.com" target="_blank">FiftyThree</a>. I got to work on a bunch of different projects while I was there, but my largest one was working on user onboarding for the new version of Paper, now available on iPhone.
    	</p>

    	<p>
			I worked in a Javascript stack and built out an interactive onboarding experience on top of an existing prototype by <a href="https://twitter.com/presstube" target="_blank">James Paterson</a>. The prototypes worked both in the browser and on mobile. For all of onboarding, I ended up building 6 interactive prototypes and conducting various visual explorations. I worked closely with <a href="https://twitter.com/pollybirdy" target="_blank">Paula Guntaur</a> who led the design for our onboarding experience. 
		</p>


		<h4>PROTOTYPING ROUND 1</h4>

		<p>
			The initial approach to onboarding focused on small pointers which would appear at opportune times in order to direct user attention toward helpful tips. The goal was to have an unobtrusive experience which would allow users to discover helpful information voluntarily. The tips would lead to the Tip Center, letting people know where they could go to get more help.
		</p>

		<p>
			I first developed 2 prototypes for a round of user testing with both new and returning users on June 18. These two prototypes both shared the same login sequence and sample content but tested variations of tip pointers, tip design, and onboarding entry points.
		</p>

		<p>
			We quickly learned that having an entry point in the text canvas with instructional content was a confusing starting point. Users benefitted more from being dropped farther from the sample content, where they were able to gather more context for the app.
		</p>

		<p>
			The pulsating tip pointers also ended up being problematic. Users became too engrossed with the sample content in the space to even notice the tip pointer. We realized that although our onboarding approach was based off of voluntary, non-intrusive interactions, it was too subtle to even attract users in the first place.
		</p>

		<h4>PROTOTYPING ROUND 2</h4>

		<p>
			We decided to skip the pointers and directly introduce tips. I built out a version which would introduce tips at opportune moments, in hopes that the contextual timing would encourage users to appreciate the tips. These tips lived directly on top of the app content, allowing users to directly interact with the content if they wished. For example, they could immediately test out the drag-to-reorder feature. 
		</p>

		<p>
			However, testing revealed that users instinctually tapped or swiped away the tips without reading them. For the next iteration, we tried to make the tips harder to dismiss by adding a modal backdrop so users would have to tap out. Any stray swipes or other gestures would not register. This design tested better than the non-modal tip, but some users still instinctively dismissed the tip pointer.
		</p>

		<h4>FINAL TIP DESIGN</h4>
		<p>
			Rapidly iterating on onboarding prototypes allowed us to quickly test designs with real users. The final design features larger, more explicit tips.

		<h4>TIP CENTER EXPLORATIONS</h4>
		<p>
			During user testing, we determined that a more permanent location for the tip center was needed. I worked on visual explorations for what it might mean to move the "?" out of the canvas tray, making it easier to access help in all views.
		</p>

		<p>
			We decided to place the "?" mark in the top right of all views, shifting it slightly to accommodate for the user avatar. Since the avatar leads to the settings menu which houses the tip center, placing the "?" in the upper righthand corner created a nice association between tips and the avatar.
		</p>

		<p>
			Having a floating “?” mark in Canvas views seemed potentially distracting for users, so I began brainstorming scenarios in which the entry point might permanently disappear from view. For example, it would make sense for the "?" mark to disappear from the text canvas view after the user discovered all rich text gestures.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thinking about the "?" contextually led us to explore a contextual tip center which surfaced the tips most relevant to the user's current place in the app. I began prototyping a hierarchical Tip Center which would only show tips relevant to your location in the app but allow you to access all tips.
		</p>

		<p>
			I prototyped a hierarchical Tip Center and a list-style Tip Center, both of which were contextual. We chose the long tip center for ease of discovery.
		</p>

		<h4>TIP-TO-TIP NAVIGATION</h4>
		<p>
			I worked on visual explorations and prototypes to make tip-to-tip navigation easier. At that point in time, there was no possible way to get to the next or previous tip from the current one. I built 3 prototypes with varying 
		</p>

		<p>
			I built 3 versions of gestural tip-to-tip navigation, each one exploring a slightly different interaction. After consulting with our engineer, we decided on a slide panel design with static page indicator numbers. I learned that subtly different interactions can make a world of difference. However, the true tradeoff is between accuracy and speed. Having accurate interactions unveils the true nature of design decisions, but it also takes time to build accurate gestural interactions.

		<h4>SUMMARY</h4>
		<p>
			By working on onboarding, I was able to see firsthand how prototyping enables rapid iteration toward a better design solution, how user testing affects the design process, and how a design moves from ideation all the way to production.
