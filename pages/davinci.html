        <h1>DaVinci Mobile</h1>

    <p>During the summer of 2014, I worked at LinkedIn as a web development intern. I asked to do design work, and my team was gracious enough to allow me to work on DaVinci Mobile, LinkedIn's pattern library for designers and developers.</p>

    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>At that time, mobile patterns lived in a linked PDF. Designers would rarely download updated versions, making it difficult to standardize new patterns.</p>

    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>We adopted a push model by creating DaVinci Mobile, a fully-responsive online pattern library where designers and developers can view components both on desktop and in context on a mobile device.</p>

    <p>We explored version 1, but after conducting some user testing, we realized version 2 was easier to parse and navigate on a mobile device. This design decision also made for a cleaner development practice: no need for different image assets for mobile.</p>

    <p>Although I was originally slated to solely work on design, I volunteered to expedite the project by developing the hub page. Throughout the project I worked closely with designers, web developers, and a fellow intern who implemented my component page designs.</p>
